    "An autoregressive (AR) model predicts future behavior based on past behavior. It’s used for forecasting when there is some correlation between values in a time series and the values that precede and succeed them. You only use past data to model the behavior, hence the name autoregressive \n",

    "The AR process is an example of a stochastic process, which have degrees of uncertainty or randomness built in. The randomness means that you might be able to predict future trends pretty well with past data, but you’re never going to get 100 percent accuracy. Usually, the process gets “close enough” for it to be useful in most scenarios.\n",

    "\n",

    "* `Predictability`: If your time series is white noise, then, by definition, it is random. You cannot reasonably model it and make predictions.\n",

    "* Is the mean/level non-zero?\n",
    "* Does the mean/level change over time?\n",
    "* Does the variance change over time?\n",
    "* Do values correlate with lag values?\n",
